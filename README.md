## Inspiration
This application was developed inspired by a [Frontend Mentor challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/note-taking-web-app-773r7bUfOG). It is not an exact replica: some elements were adapted and others were created by me.

## Instructions

1. **Prerequisites**
   - Ensure that you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/es/) installed on your computer.
   - Ensure that you have [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed on your computer.
   - Make sure you have access to the Spotify API (you'll need an API key).
